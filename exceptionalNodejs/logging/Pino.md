# Centralizing and monitoring your Node.js logs
One of the main advantages of logging in a structured format is the ability to ingest them into a centralized logging system to be indexed, searched, and analyzed efficiently. By consolidating all log data into a central location, you will gain a holistic view of your systems' health and performance, making it easier to identify patterns, spot anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.

Centralizing logs also simplifies compliance efforts by providing a single source of truth for auditing and monitoring purposes. In addition, it helps to ensure that the relevant logs are properly retained and easily accessible for any regulatory or legal audits.

Furthermore, with the right tools, centralizing logs can enable real-time alerting and proactive monitoring, allowing you to detect and respond to issues before they become critical. This can significantly reduce downtime and minimize the impact on your organization's operations.

Now that you've configured Pino in your Node.js application to output structured logs, the next step is to centralize your logs in a log management system so that you can reap the benefits of logging in a structured format. Better Stack is one such solution that can tail your logs, analyze and visualize them, and help with alerting when certain patterns are detected.
