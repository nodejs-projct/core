# Buffer Management

Buffers are essential when dealing with:

1. raw binary data,
2. file streams, or
3. network sockets.

`Buffers` allow you to interact with binary data directly, bypassing the need to convert it into strings or other formats, which is often inefficient and unnecessary for tasks like `file handling`, `network communication`, or interacting with binary protocols.

## What is a Buffer?
A Buffer is a temporary storage area in memory that holds binary data. It is primarily used to work with raw data that isnâ€™t necessarily in a string format. Buffers are especially useful in I/O operations like reading and writing files, handling streams, or communicating over network protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP).
